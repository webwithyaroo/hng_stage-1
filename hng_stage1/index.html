        <h1>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h1>

        <section>
          <h2>Goal 1: Mastering JavaScript Frameworks</h2>
          <p>
            In the next two years, I aim to master popular JavaScript frameworks
            such as React and Vue.js. These frameworks are pivotal in modern web
            development, enabling the creation of dynamic and responsive user
            interfaces. I plan to dive deep into advanced concepts, contribute
            to open-source projects, and build several complex applications to
            solidify my understanding and proficiency.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Goal 2: Building a Strong Portfolio</h2>
          <p>
            I intend to create a robust portfolio showcasing a variety of
            projects that demonstrate my skills and versatility in frontend
            development. This will include personal projects, freelance work,
            and contributions to community initiatives. A well-rounded portfolio
            will not only highlight my technical abilities but also my
            problem-solving skills and creativity.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Goal 3: Enhancing Design Skills</h2>
          <p>
            While my primary focus is on development, I recognize the importance
            of design in creating appealing and user-friendly interfaces. Over
            the next two years, I plan to improve my design skills by studying
            UI/UX principles, experimenting with different design tools, and
            following the latest design trends. This will help me create more
            visually appealing and intuitive websites.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Goal 4: Learning Backend Development</h2>
          <p>
            To become a full-stack developer, I will dedicate time to learning
            backend technologies. Understanding how the server-side of web
            applications works will allow me to create more comprehensive and
            integrated solutions. I will start with Node.js and Express, and
            gradually explore other backend frameworks and databases.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Goal 5: Contributing to the Community</h2>
          <p>
            I believe in the power of community and the importance of giving
            back. In the next two years, I plan to contribute to open-source
            projects, write technical articles, and participate in coding
            forums. Sharing knowledge and helping others will not only improve
            my skills but also build a network of like-minded professionals.
